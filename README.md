Based on this [hostpath-provisioner](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/nfs-provisioner/tree/master/demo/hostpath-provisioner)
hopefully this will be merged into the official repo once one is created.

for now, you can install this provisioner using the helm chart located [here](https://github.com/mirusresearch/charts/tree/master/incubator/hostpath-provisioner)
